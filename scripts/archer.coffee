     Archer: No, I think Jenga's a game, and...\n
     Krenshaw: What if I'd been real KGB?\n
     Archer: I assume you would be trying to suck a promotion out of some Russian guy's cock.\n
     Krenshaw: Well, maybe I never get promoted...\n
     Archer: ...and never will...\n
     Krenshaw: ...because my mommy’s not the boss!\n

     Archer: That's not... a real place.\n
     Mallory: I have fifty agents who would literally kill to move up to your position. And if you don't square up your operations account by Monday, they won't need to. Your position will be vacant! Sterling!\n
     Archer: Sorry, I was picturing Whore Island.\n

     Archer: ...Sorry, let's just call it what it is: food rapist.\n
     Pam: Not a pretty name, is it?",

     Cheryl: Ooh, that would make me... uncomfortable.\n
     Archer: Ugh, God, everything makes you uncomfortable!",

    "[Archer and Cheryl are naked and on the floor of his apartment]\n

     Archer: Just the tip. [Pause] Actually, I don't have any cash on me. Could you... get it? I also need cab fare. Awww, Ugly Duckling. Bork Bork.",

    "Archer: Well, thanks for nothing, Carol. Now I need to break into ISIS headquarters in a $900 turtleneck. And if it gets ruined I'll make you drink heavy cream, you... Carol!\n
     [Archer zip-lines across to the roof of ISIS]\n
     Archer: Wow, that was actually pretty easy! Thanks, new turtleneck! [rips his turtleneck] Aw, f— And thank you, duffle bag!",

    "Archer: Holy shit, our security is atrocious. Seriously, it's really bad.\n
     [He sits at the computer, which prompts him for a password]\n
     Archer: Password. Hmm, password? How about \"Guest\".\n
     [He types in \"Guest\" and it works]\n
     Archer: No way! It can't be. Jesus Christ, that is just... babytown frolics.",

    "Archer: Do not wind her up. That is a big gun and she is baby crazy.\n
     Lana: \"Baby crazy\"?!\n
     Archer: That's why I broke up with her.\n

     Archer: See?! All you talk about is baby shit! Because you're baby crazy!\n
     Lana: You want to see crazy?!\n
     Archer: No! I've seen that movie and, spoiler alert, it ends with a closet full of my suits on fire!\n
     Lana: I wish you'd been wearing one!\n
     Archer: Who would want to wear an on-fire suit!\n
     Lana: Cosplay enthusiasts!\n
     Archer: What?\n
     Lana: Wait! No! Shit!",

    "[Krenshaw walks in on Archer breaking into the mainframe]\n
     Archer: Hey! I was just talking about you, and about how this isn't what it looks like.\n
     Krenshaw: Lot of that going around.\n
     Archer: Yeah, it's an epidemic.\n
     Krenshaw: For example, my real name is Kremenski.\n
     Archer: Is that... sound... is that Jewish?\n
     Krenshaw: It's Russian.\n
     Archer: Um. [long pause] Russian Jewish?\n
     Krenshaw: I'm the mole, idiot.\n
     [Later]\n
     Archer: Lana! Krenshaw's a mole! And his real name isn't Krenshaw, it's Kremenski. Definitely Russian! Possibly a Jew! Thoughts?",

    "Kremensky: Picture her, dead in the gutter, and what your pathetic life would be like without old Mommy Dearest.\n
     Lana: [Held at gunpoint by Archer] JESUS CHRIST! He's got an ERECTION!\n
     Krenshaw: [holding Malory hostage, but suddenly pushes her away] What is wrong with you people!?\n
     Archer: [shoots Krenshaw] Me? Nothing! You, on the other hand— [Mallory hits Archer with her handbag] What's in there, buckles?\n
     Mallory: AN ERECTION?! The thought of me dying gives you an erection?!\n
     Archer: Just half of one. The other half would have missed you. Oh wait...",

     Archer: What?\n
     Lana: [Points a gun at Archer] Call him that again.\n
